### step-by-step summary and explanation of the event loop phases and their execution order:

1. **Timers phase**: This phase executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` with a due time. If there are no timers due, the event loop proceeds to the next phase.

2. **I/O callbacks phase**: This phase executes almost all callbacks except for close callbacks, timers, and `setImmediate()`. It processes the I/O queue until the queue is exhausted or the next timer is due.

3. **Idle, prepare phase**: This phase is used internally by Node.js and is not relevant to the execution order.

4. **Poll phase**: This phase retrieves new I/O events. If there are no timers due and no tasks in the queue, it checks for `setImmediate()` callbacks and executes them. If there are no `setImmediate()` callbacks, it blocks for I/O and waits.

5. **Check phase**: This phase executes `setImmediate()` callbacks.

6. **Close callbacks phase**: This phase executes close callbacks, such as `socket.on('close', ...)`.

Regarding `process.nextTick()` and Promise callbacks, they are considered microtasks. The event loop processes microtasks before executing the next callback/task in the same phase. Here's the corrected version of your summary:

1. **Timers phase**: Are there any timers due? If yes, execute timer callbacks and then process microtasks.
2. **I/O callbacks phase**: Are there any I/O callbacks? If yes, execute I/O callbacks and then process microtasks.
3. **Poll phase**: Are there any timers due? If no, are there any tasks in the queue? If no, execute `setImmediate()` callbacks and then process microtasks.
